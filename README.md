# prio3
Prio3 - World of Warcraft Classic addon

"Priority 3" looting addon
==========================

You can import simple CSV strings on the Addon config page:

    Username;Prio1;Prio2;Prio3

where Prio1, 2, 3 can be numeric item Ids, or even strings with the IDs somewhere in (will take first number found), e.g. wowhead links.


The great Prio3 website at sahne-team.de will provide an export shortly.


/prio3 will open an overview on loot

If a loot window is opened, it will announce priorities of items found to the raid.

Short-term planning: (so, these don't work just yet)
- Share with other people in the group/raid
- Work on Loot roll announcements (currently Addon user needs to open the loot window)

Mid-term
- Note if someone got an item and remove user from list
- Announce users their choices on raid start to validate

Long-term
- Accept whispers to actually set Prio3 loot
